<br/>If you are still reading, here’s a brief into our colleague's world:

<p>It's 2 of them who have been on their own for last 5-6 years supporting each other and dreaming to make it big. That’s their small world. Yes, it’s she(22) and her mother(52).</p>

<p>They were progressing quite well in their pursuit to have a good life. The mother supported the daughter throughout her days in Engineering College (4 yrs). The daughter started her career very recently and as she was making her mother proud with her achievements, they figured out, the mother won’t be there for long, if not treated in a good medical facility.</p>

<p>Her mother got diagnosed with cancer in food pipe (advanced stage). The daughter started her treatment by raising some funds with help from her colleagues. But as we all know, treatment for Cancer has a big cost and the daughter burned out the initial funding quite fast due to a costly operation. The daughter is again in need of funds of the tune of $18750 or 1200000 Indian Rupees to continue her treatment.</p>
<p>Live and stay healthy, donate a cup of coffee today <b>($1 or 50 Indian Rupees)</b> to this campaign. Please visit our fundraising partner Ketto for online donations @<a href="https://www.ketto.org/emptycoffeecupselfie" target="_blank">https://www.ketto.org/emptycoffeecupselfie</a></p>
